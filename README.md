# battleships
Makers Academy battleships challenge, week 2

Challenge is to build a battleships game. At first it will just run in the Ruby Interpretor (irb), but next week it will be modified and deployed onto the web. Not sure how yet, but I suspect it will be using Sinatra.

The process used to build this app could generally be outlined as follows:

- Build a user story
- Code using TDD (rspec), following Agile principles.

New terminology encountered and being followed this week includes 'EDUF' (Enough Design Upfront), SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).

The main challenge in this design is deciding what 'responsibilities' each Class should have, and what those Classes should be.
